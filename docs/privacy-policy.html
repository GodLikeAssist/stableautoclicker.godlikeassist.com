        <h3>2. App Permissions and Information Collection</h3>
        <h5>App Permissions Involved</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Accessibility Service (Necessary)
            <p>
              When you are using our app, we will request this permission to
              help implement our app's main features, such as simulating auto
              clicks and swipes on the screen. We do not collect your private
              data through this permission.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Ignore Battery Optimization (Optional)</li>
          <p>
            Turning on this permission ensures that the app will not be
            automatically closed by the system when the device battery is low.
            This allows the app to run safely in the background and provide a
            consistently stable service for users. This permission is optional,
            and without it, the quality of your experience may be affected.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <h5>Information Collection</h5>
        <p>
          The information We collect and process depends on how You use Our
          Service.
        </p>

        <h5>The information You actively provide during your use of Our app</h5>
        <p>
          You can freely create scripts using our app and the script data is
          only stored locally on your device unless you actively log in and back
          up. Besides, We will collect some operating information when you
          interact with Our App, including the button click and page view. We
          use this information to provide You with personal service and improve
          Our App, including general settings You make (such as your choice of
          preferred language) and the time and duration of your activities on
          Our Service (which can help Us improve features that You may pay less
          attention to).
        </p>

        <h5>Information from third-party social media services</h5>
        <p>
          If You choose to use the login service (for Our backup feature) using
          a third-party social network Account (such as Google), in that case,
          We may collect some third-party data automatically, such as your
          Account name, email address and public information associated with
          that Account.
        </p>

        <h5>The Information You actively provide when you send feedback</h5>
        <p>
          If You want to send feedback to us to improve your using experience,
          We may collect your usage data, like theme type, App Version, system
          version, screen size, language, country, app language, device, time
          zone, network, account, and whether you subscribed, removed the ads.
          This information is not mandatory collected, We do NOT collect them

          feedback data periodically for a month.
